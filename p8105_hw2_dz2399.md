### Read in the data according to instuctions

``` r
df_nyc <- read_csv(file='./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, starts_with('station'),starts_with('route'),entry, vending,ada,entrance_type) %>% 
  select(-station_location) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode (entry, 'YES' = T, 'NO'=F))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
dim(df_nyc)
```

    ## [1] 1868   19

The dataset contains the following variables: line, station\_name, station longitute and latitude, the route that the train serves, entry and entry types, vending, and ada. The data cleaning process is that: firstly, read in the data from the directory and conduct a column-name-cleaning with the function clean\_names; then, select the desired variables; lastly, recode the entry variable with yes equals to T and no to F. The dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868, 19. This is not a tidy data, because the route variables are spreadout to multiple columns rather than a single column.

### How many distinct stations are there?
