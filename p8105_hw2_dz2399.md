Problem 1
---------

### Read in the data according to instuctions

``` r
df_nyc <- read_csv(file='./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, starts_with('station'),starts_with('route'),entry, vending,ada,entrance_type) %>% 
  select(-station_location) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode (entry, 'YES' = T, 'NO'=F))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
dim(df_nyc)
```

    ## [1] 1868   19

The dataset contains the following variables: line, station\_name, station longitute and latitude, the route that the train serves, entry and entry types, vending, and ada. The data cleaning process is that: firstly, read in the data from the directory and conduct a column-name-cleaning with the function clean\_names; then, select the desired variables; lastly, recode the entry variable with yes equals to T and no to F. The dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868, 19. This is not a tidy data, because the route variables are spreadout to multiple columns rather than a single column.

#### How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
dim(distinct(df_nyc, station_name))[1]
```

    ## [1] 356

There are 356 distinct stations in the dataset.

#### How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
df_nyc %>% 
  filter(ada==T) %>% 
  distinct(station_name) %>% 
  dim()
```

    ## [1] 73  1

There are 73 stations that are ADA compliant in the dataset.

#### What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
dim(df_nyc %>% filter(vending=='NO'))[1]/dim(df_nyc)[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.09796574

Among all entrancss/ exits in the dataset, 9.7% of the entrance/exit do not have vending machines.
